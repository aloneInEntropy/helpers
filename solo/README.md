# Solo files

A folder containing all files seen in the base repository. These files do not require each other and can be run on their own (though they 
may require imports from external libraries.) These are created with the intention to share a single file instead of downloading the entire repository.

These files are messy and may not be as clean, easy to read, or as stable as their interconnected counterparts. There is no reason for this other than
laziness on my part. Sorry. lol
