# Iris' Helpers

A place where I (plan to) store files that help with annoying, exhaustive or otherwise tedious mathematical or programming tasks that would require a lot of writing or typing out.

Files added currently:
  - Gauss-Seidel iterative solver
    - Takes in a matrix by input and prints out the steps for each iteration to the console, where they can be copied easily.
   

Planned:
  - LU decomposition via Crout's method
  - Maybe a GUI???
